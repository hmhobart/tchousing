## Files
This project utilizes files form various sources including the Census, and the 
Teton County, WY GIS archives. 

Census: https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2020&layergroup=Counties+%28and+equivalent%29
- You will need to dowload county and road data from here

Teton County:https://www.greenwoodmap.com/tetonwy/mapserver/download/download.html?
- You will need to download the zoning, ownership, and conservation easements packages from this archive.

The census files can remain zipped, however, each of the Teton County files 
will need to be unzipped to extract various parts of each file to ensure a 
full dataset.
